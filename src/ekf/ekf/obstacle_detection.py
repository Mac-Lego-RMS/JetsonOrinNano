"""
Obstacle (traffic sign) detection from the colour-classified point cloud.

Input is /camera_lidar/colored_scan, where the camera-LiDAR node has already
CLASSIFIED each point: pillars come out as pure (255,0,0) red or (0,255,0)
green, parking walls as (255,0,255) magenta, everything else keeps its original
colour. Detection here is an exact byte match -- no colour thresholds.

Frames: the cloud is in the RAW LiDAR frame. Verified with a pillar placed 1 m
straight ahead: it appears at bearing +-180 deg, x = -0.96. So the same mirror
correction as scan_to_points applies (x_robot = -x_cloud, y_robot = -y_cloud),
plus the rear-axle offset.

Clustering is SPATIAL (region growing), not bearing-sorted: bearing sorting
breaks at the +-180 deg wraparound and merges objects that share a bearing but
sit at different distances.

Noise rejection is by COMPACTNESS, not point count: a 44 mm pillar fits in a
~5 cm circle, while camera noise misclassified on a wall smears along it.

Each detection also carries the angular SECTOR it occupies, so the wall
extraction can mask those directions out (see mask_sectors). Pillars standing
near a corner otherwise corrupt the front-wall fit and delay the direction
latch by seconds.
